Deep learning methods for synthesizing missing breaset MRI contrasts.

PURPOSE: To develop a supervised learning framework, Sat2Nu, using a shallow U-Net architecture that synthesizes nonfat-supporessed breast MRIs from fat-suppressed inputs.

MOTIVATION: Standard of care breast MRI typically only includes fat-suppressed images, where the fat signal is nulled and the hormone-responsive tissue is bright. Sometimes, however, the nonfat-suppressed images (fat signal is bright, hormone-responsive tissue is dark) is necessary for evaluting fat necrosis and fatty lesions as well as for downstream quantitative tasks involving segmentation of the hormone responsive tissue.
